# Project-Management
Efficient project planning 
##
The program manages several resources in the project. In addition, users are able to register the expected time and budgets for handling the resources. And later, they can register the actual time and budgets for handling the resources. Budget calculates differently for each type of the resource. There are three types of the resources:
* **Employee**: An employee has a specific loan, a specific working time and a varied extra work time in each month of the year.
* **Project Manager**: A project manager has an exact contract price for a specific period.
* **Consultant**: A consultant has a specific time based budget.
